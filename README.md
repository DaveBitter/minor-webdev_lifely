## General
This repository holds documentation for [Lifely's](https://lifely.nl/) [Fresh Heroes project](https://freshheroes.com/), part of the minor "Webdevelopment" at the [HvA](http://www.hva.nl/)

## What did I focus on?
The website is accessible through traditional inputs like pointers and keyboards. I want to make use of gesture inputs to navigate through the entire site and for other actions that can be enhanced by this. Furthermore, I wanted to add a cool feature that made use of a device's gyroscoop. 

## Initial idea generation
Through quickly sketching idea's I came up with a few idea's to build. I didn't build all of the idea's due to time constraints and generally purposfulness (e.g. rotate gesture to go through browser history). You can view the initial idea's below.
